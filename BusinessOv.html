      <p>
        Please return the vehicle with a full tank of gas, unless otherwise agreed upon. Driving is restricted to designated service areas; taking the vehicle outside these areas may result in additional charges or cancellation of the rental agreement.

      <h2>Damage and Insurance Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Our rentals include basic insurance coverage for accidents, theft, and minor damage. However, this does not cover incidents caused by negligence, illegal activity, or violations of our rental terms. Additional insurance options are available for those who want extra protection. In the event of damage, a deductible will apply, and the renter may be held liable up to the full cost depending on the situation.

        For late returns, we allow a 1-hour grace period. After that, additional charges apply either by the hour or a full day’s rate, depending on how long the return is delayed. Repeated or excessive delays may result in further penalties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cancellations made at least 48 hours before the scheduled pick-up time qualify for a full refund. Cancellations within 24 hours are subject to a partial fee. Rebooking is possible but may include extra charges depending on vehicle availability and timing.
